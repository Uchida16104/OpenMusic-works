Schema for strings, cembalo, ryuteki, and samplers

This music was composed by [OpenMusic](https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/openmusic/), and being used overtones made by spectral analysis, chance music, chaos theory, minimalism music, retrograde canon.

I inform in advance the accident that maybe the sound is distorted at the end of video.

Instruments
1. Strings (Violin, Viola, Cello, Contrabass)
2. Cembalo
3. Ryuteki flute
4. Samplers (It's desirable that you prepare 4 samplers)

*You should convert .mp3 files in "OpenMusic-works/Schema for strings, cembalo, ryuteki, and samplers/in-files/" folder to .wav files, then convert them to sdif files which is for spectral analysis in [SPEAR](http://klingbeil.com/spear/) before using.
