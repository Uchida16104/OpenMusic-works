# Essence for harp, organ, samplers, and live electronics

I made this music by using [OpenMusic](https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/openmusic/) and [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/).

Also, it's used frequency analysis, overtones, ring modulation, and chance music.

Instruments
1. Harp
2. Organ
3. Samplers (It's desirable that you prepare 2 samplers from [here](https://github.com/Uchida16104/OpenMusic-works/raw/main/Essence%20for%20harp%2C%20organ%2C%20samplers%2C%20and%20live%20electronics/in-files/sampler.mp3))
4. Effects (They're used as <strong>live electronics</strong>, it's prepared reverb and delay effects for harp, and done chorus and rotary effects for organ)
